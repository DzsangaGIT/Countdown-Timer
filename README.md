# STOPPER: Real-Time Clock, Stopwatch, and Countdown Timer

## Overview

**STOPPER** is a simple web-based tool that combines three functionalities into one interface:

1. **Real-Time Clock** – Displays the current date and time.
2. **Stopwatch** – A functional stopwatch with Start, Stop, and Reset controls.
3. **Countdown Timer** – A countdown to a user-specified target date and time, displaying the remaining time in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

This app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a sleek and responsive interface for managing time in various ways.

## How It Works

### 1. Real-Time Clock

The real-time clock updates every second, using JavaScript to grab the current date and display it in the app. This feature is continuously updated via JavaScript's `setInterval()` function.

### 2. Stopwatch

The stopwatch allows the user to:
- **Start** the timer and begin counting from `00:00:00`.
- **Stop** the timer at any time.
- **Reset** the timer back to `00:00:00` when needed.

The stopwatch uses `setInterval()` to increment the time every second.

### 3. Countdown Timer

The countdown timer allows the user to:
- Set a target date and time using a date input field.
- View the remaining time in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- When the target time is reached, the timer displays "Time's up!" and stops counting.

## Styles (CSS)

The app is designed with a modern, dark theme, enhanced with gradient backgrounds and subtle animations for a smooth user experience. The layout is responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktops and mobile devices.

- **Gradient Background**: A dynamic gradient background enhances the app's appearance.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts automatically for mobile screens.
- **Smooth Animations**: Elements like buttons and sections are animated for a modern feel.

## JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript manages the three main components of the app:
1. **Clock**: Continuously updates to show the current date.
2. **Stopwatch**: Manages start, stop, and reset functionality for a simple timer.
3. **Countdown Timer**: Handles the logic for countdown, including target date validation and formatting the remaining time.

The app uses JavaScript's `setInterval()` function to ensure the time is updated regularly and efficiently.
